module PublicActivity
  module Renderable
    # Virtual attribute returning text description of the activity
    # using the activity's key to translate using i18n.
    def text(params = {})
      # TODO: some helper for key transformation for two supported formats
      k = key.split('.')
      k.unshift('activity') if k.first != 'activity'
      k = k.join('.')

      I18n.t(k, parameters.merge(params) || {})

    # Renders activity from views.

    # @param [ActionView::Base] context
    # @return [nil] nil
    #
    # Renders activity to the given ActionView context with included
    # AV::Helpers::RenderingHelper (most commonly just ActionView::Base)
    #
    # The *preferred* *way* of rendering activities is
    # to provide a template specifying how the rendering should be happening.
    # However, one may choose using _I18n_ based approach when developing
    # an application that supports plenty of languages.
    #
    # If partial view exists that matches the *key* attribute
    # renders that partial with local variables set to contain both
    # Activity and activity_parameters (hash with indifferent access)
    #
    # Otherwise, it outputs the I18n translation to the context
    # @example Render a list of all activities from a view (erb)
    #   <ul>
    #     <% for activity in PublicActivity::Activity.all %>
    #      <li><%= render_activity(activity) %></li>
    #     <% end %>
    #   </ul>
    #
    # = Layouts
    # You can supply a layout that will be used for activity partials
    # with :layout param.
    # Keep in mind that layouts for partials are also partials.
    # @example Supply a layout
    #   # in views:
    #   #   All examples look for a layout in app/views/layouts/_activity.erb
    #    render_activity @activity, :layout => "activity"
    #    render_activity @activity, :layout => "layouts/activity"
    #    render_activity @activity, :layout => :activity
    #
    #   # app/views/layouts/_activity.erb
    #   <p><%= a.created_at %></p>
    #   <%= yield %>
    #
    # = Creating a template
    # To use templates for formatting how the activity should render,
    # create a template based on activity key, for example:
    #
    # Given a key _activity.article.create_, create directory tree
    # _app/views/public_activity/article/_ and create the _create_ partial there
    #
    # Note that if a key consists of more than three parts splitted by commas, your
    # directory structure will have to be deeper, for example:
    #   activity.article.comments.destroy => app/views/public_activity/articles/comments/_destroy.html.erb
    #
    # == Variables in templates
    # From within a template there are two variables at your disposal:
    # * activity (aliased as *a* for a shortcut)
    # * params   (aliased as *p*) [converted into a HashWithIndifferentAccess]
    #
    # @example Template for key: _activity.article.create_ (erb)
    #   <p>
    #     Article <strong><%= p[:name] %></strong>
    #     was written by <em><%= p["author"] %></em>
    #     <%= distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(a.created_at) %>
    #   </p>
